My name is Jonathan Grigg
My major is mathematics
I'm in this class because it's required for my major and because I've been interested in learning to program for a long time
I think I'll learn the basics of programing
I secretly wish I'd gone to college a lot sooner and had majored in computer science, but being a parent I don't have the luxury of taking too much time
